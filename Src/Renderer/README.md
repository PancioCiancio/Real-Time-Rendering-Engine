Most of the difficulties were solved with the help of **Vulkan Discord** users.

## Synchronization

### Presentation

Separation of CPU and GPU synchronization is important because the swapchain's image count depend
on the driver, and we should deal with it. Howerver, it doesn't define how many frame the CPU need
to generate to keep the GPU busy. This is commonly mistaken.

**Frame In Flight** (FIF) defines the amount of frame generated by the CPU, commonly set to 2 or at
most 3
to avoid input lag. Each frame has its own: Command Pool, Command Buffer, Submit Fence, Acquired
Image Semaphore.

**Swapchain Images and Framebuffers** are driver dependent, and they should be handled properly. We
cannot control the min images are returned from the swapchain. For such reason the two
synchronization are separated. Only the RenderFinishedSemaphore depends on the GPU.
